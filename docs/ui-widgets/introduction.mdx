#### What is widgets?

In general widgets are code snippets that one could embed in their own webapp to render certain UI views without needing to code UI on their own.

The Togai UI widgets is a embeddable javascript code for our customers to be able to render principal togai views such as metrics, credit transactions, invoices etc for one of your accounts amidst of your own layout in your app.

#### How will it help you?

If you want to render say for instance customer's usage or cost metrics you need to fetch data from the togai's REST api and write custom implementation to render the UI and to keep up with the updates in the api schema if any. With Togai UI widgets, you can just install the package, import the needed view and use it to render the UI with minimal configuration.

#### How does it work?

The Togai widgets are written as framework agnostic [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements) and it uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) under the hood.
