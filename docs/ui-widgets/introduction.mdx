#### What are widgets?

In general, widgets are code snippets that one could embed in their own webapp to render certain UI views without needing to code UI on their own.
The Togai UI widgets is an embeddable javascript code for our customers to be able to render principal Togai views such as metrics, credit transactions, invoices etc for one of your accounts amidst your own layout in your app.


#### How will it help you?

If you want to render for instance customer’s usage or cost metrics you need to fetch data from the Togai’s REST API and write a custom implementation to render the UI and to keep up with the updates in the API schema if any. With Togai UI widgets, you can install the package, import the needed view and use it to render the UI with minimal configuration.

#### How does it work?

The Togai widgets are written as framework-agnostic custom elements and it uses Vue.js under the hood.
